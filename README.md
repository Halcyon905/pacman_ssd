# PACMAN game

## About the Game
This repository has been created as a part of the
project for Software Specification & Design Lab.
It contains the Java code for the classic arcade
game, Pacman. The player plays as pacman and 
their job is to eat all the pellets in order 
to win and attempt to gain the highest score 
possible.   
To elevate your experience, we've added
a feature that allows you to select your 
desired map before the game begins. So, 
aim for the highest score and enjoy the game!


## Prerequisites
- Java JDK (recommended for version 17)
- Java Swing


## Installing and Running the Game

Follow these steps to get the game running:

1. Clone this repository into your desired directory using the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/Halcyon905/pacman_ssd.git```
2. Navigate into the cloned directory.
3. Run the 'MainLoop' file to start the game

## Gameplay
To play the game, use the WASD keys on your keyboard
to navigate Pacman through the walls. Eating pellets will 
increase your score, and eating power pellets will make the ghosts
vulnerable for a short period. Avoid contact with the ghosts, 
as they will cause you to lose a life.
